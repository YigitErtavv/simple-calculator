## How It Works

The Simple Calculator is a beginner-friendly C program designed to perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

**Program Logic:**

1. **User Input:**  
   - The program displays a menu with four options: add, subtract, multiply, and divide.  
   - The user selects an operation by entering a number (1-4).  

2. **Number Input:**  
   - After selecting an operation, the program asks the user to enter **two numbers**.  
   - These numbers are stored in variables `a` and `b`.  

3. **Perform Operation:**  
   - Using a `switch-case` statement, the program executes the chosen arithmetic operation:  
     - `1` → Addition (`a + b`)  
     - `2` → Subtraction (`a - b`)  
     - `3` → Multiplication (`a * b`)  
     - `4` → Division (`a / b`)  

4. **Error Handling:**  
   - If the user chooses division and the second number is zero, the program prints an error message: **“Cannot divide by zero!”**  

5. **Output:**  
   - The program prints the result of the selected operation with two decimal points of precision.  
   - If the user enters an invalid choice, the program prints **“Invalid choice!”**
